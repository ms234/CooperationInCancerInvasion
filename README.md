# Mix \& Match: Phenotypic coexistence as a key facilitator of cancer invasion

![A summary figure illustrating the main story line of our paper. A histology image with different cancer cell populations, our PDE model, and a visual summary figure of our main result that mixing of tumour sub-population may facilitate invasion. ](figure.png)

This repository contains the python code for numerical simulation of our PDE model from *"Mix & Match: Phenotypic coexistence as a key facilitator of cancer invasion"* [1]. All details for how to run the code, can be found in the Jupyter notebook. In addition, the notebook contains the code to generate Figures 3, 5, and 8 from the paper which illustrate the invasion dynamics of the tumour according to the model. A free pre-print of our paper can be found on the bioRxiv [2].
