# Mix \& Match: Phenotypic coexistence as a key facilitator of cancer invasion

This repository contains the python code for numerical simulation of our PDE model from *"Mix & Match: Phenotypic coexistence as a key facilitator of cancer invasion"* (Strobl et al, accepted). All details for how to run the code, can be found in the Jupyter notebook. In addition, the notebook contains the code to generate Figures 3, 5, and 8 from the paper which illustrate the invasion dynamics of the tumour according to the model.
